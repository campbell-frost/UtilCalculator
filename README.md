# UtilCalculator

This project allows a user to input how much money goes to each utility per month, and calculates what each utility needs to give the others to make each ammount even.  

The use-case for this is each monthly utility is covered by a different person.  At the end of the day, each person wants to spend the same ammount of money.  This app lets the users input how much they spend per month and then returns how much needs to be payed to the people with the higher costs to make everything even  


## 💿 Install

## 💡 Usage

This section covers how to start the development server and build your project for production.

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
yarn dev
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

> Add NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings' to suppress the JSON import warnings that happen as part of the Vuetify import mapping. If you are on Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, you can change this to NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'. If you don't mind the warning, you can remove this from your package.json dev script.

### Building for Production

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
yarn build
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

Once the build process is completed, your application will be ready for deployment in a production environment.
